This is the code for my paper "Electromagnetic effective degree of freedom of an MIMO system in free space" published in IEEE AWPL. This Matlab code calculates the vector channel matrix of a free-space MIMO communication system based on dyadic Green's function. With this code, it's easy to estimate the capacity or effective degree of freedom (EDOF) of a near-field MIMO communication system, especially the effects of polarizations.
